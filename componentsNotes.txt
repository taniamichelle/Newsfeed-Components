*******COMPONENTS*******
-components: As we build larger and more feature-rich web pages, we may notice a trend in our code; 
elements that are essentially using the same functionality and styling with minor differences in 
the data they present. In an effort to keep our code readable, reusable, and most of all DRY, we can 
build on these repeating patterns and create components. Components are reusable pieces of code that 
can be used to build elements sharing functionality and styling. Components are the heart of any 
dynamic web application and Javascript framework.
